# Mystify for TS4

Mystify is a small mod which allows adding temporary transparency to sims and objects. The modifications are not persisted in a save game.

* Everything between 30 and 100 % is quite safe to apply.
* With 0 to 20 % opacity sims and objets are hard to see for the player and one can't click on them.
* Sims will still interact with invisible sims and objects.

The normal menu allows to set the opacity to 40, 60, 80 and 100 % (Show).
The 'more' menu adds 30, 50, 70 and 70 %.
The 'risky' menu supports (Hide) 0, 10 and 20 %.
The 'reset' menu allows to reset all sims and/or objects.
To reset the currently played sim select a random sim or object and select Mystify > Reset > Self.

## Installation
The ZIP file should be extracted into the `The Sims 4` folder to make sure that the folder structure is set up correctly.
* The mod documentation (everything in `mod_documentation`) should also not be stores in `Mods`.
* The mod `mystify.ts4cript` itself should be stored in `Mods` or in a sub folder.
* I highly recommend installing it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.

Unless not yet installed: Install [S4CL](https://github.com/ColonolNutty/Sims4CommunityLibrary/releases/latest) as this mod is required.
Download `sims4communitylib.v1.77.zip` (or higher) and extract sims4communitylib.ts4script and sims4communitylib.package to `Mods/` or better `Mods/_cn_/` 
* I highly recommend installing the S4CL files into `_cn_` so you know who created this mod.

`testingcheats true` may be required as it adds only 'DEBUG' interactions.

## Compatibility
This mod has been tested with 1.88.228 (2022-05-27) and S4CL v1.77 (2022-05-04).
It is expected to work with many older and upcoming releases of TS4 and S4CL.

### Future

A 'TheVoid/Nothingness' class is planned. It should be triggered by transparent objects and make one object after the other within the zone invisible.
