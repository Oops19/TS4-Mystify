# 🌫️ Mystify for TS4

Mystify is a small mod that adds temporary transparency to Sims and objects.  
These changes are **not saved** — they are reset when the game is reloaded.

- Opacity between **30% and 100%** is safe to use.
- Opacity between **0% and 20%** makes Sims and objects hard to see and unclickable.
- Sims will still interact with invisible Sims and objects.

## ⚙️ Menus
- **Normal menu**: 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% (Show)
- **More menu**: 30%, 50%, 70%, 70%
- **Risky menu**: 0%, 10%, 20% (Hide)
- **Reset menu**: Reset all Sims and/or objects  
  To reset the currently played Sim, select any Sim or object and choose:  
  `Mystify > Reset > Self`

## 🔮 Future
A `TheVoid/Nothingness` class is planned.  
It will be triggered by transparent objects and gradually make other objects in the zone invisible.

## 📦 Dependencies
Download the ZIP file - not the source code.
Required components:
* [This Mod](../../releases/latest)
* [TS4-Library](https://github.com/Oops19/TS4-Library/releases/latest)
* [S4CL](https://github.com/ColonolNutty/Sims4CommunityLibrary/releases/latest)
* [The Sims 4](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4)

If not already installed, download and install TS4 and the listed mods. All are available for free.

## 📥 Installation
* Locate the localized `The Sims 4` folder (it contains the `Mods` folder).
* Extract the ZIP file directly into this folder.

This will create:
* `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.ts4script`
* `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.package`
* `mod_data/$mod_name/*`
* `mod_documentation/$mod_name/*` (optional)
* `mod_sources/$mod_name/*` (optional)

Additional notes:
* CAS and Build/Buy UGC without scripts will create `Mods/o19/$mod_name.package`.
* A log file `mod_logs/$mod_name.txt` will be created once data is logged.
* You may safely delete `mod_documentation/` and `mod_sources/` folders if not needed.

### 📂 Manual Installation
If you prefer not to extract directly into `The Sims 4`, you can extract to a temporary location and copy files manually:
* Copy `mod_data/` contents to `The Sims 4/mod_data/` (usually required).
* `mod_documentation/` is for reference only — not required.
* `mod_sources/` is not needed to run the mod.
* `.ts4script` files can be placed in a folder inside `Mods/`, but storing them in `_o19_` is recommended for clarity.
* `.package` files can be placed in a anywhere inside `Mods/`.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If installed correctly, no troubleshooting should be necessary.
For manual installs, verify the following:
* Does your localized `The Sims 4` folder exist? (e.g. localized to Die Sims 4, Les Sims 4, Los Sims 4, The Sims 4, ...)
  * Does it contain a `Mods/` folder?
    * Does Mods/_o19_/ contain:
      * `ts4lib.ts4script` and `ts4lib.package`?
      * `{mod_name}.ts4script` and/or `{mod_name}.package`
* Does `mod_data/` contain `{mod_name}/` with files?
* Does `mod_logs/` contain:
  * `Sims4CommunityLib_*_Messages.txt`?
  * `TS4-Library_*_Messages.txt`?
  * `{mod_name}_*_Messages.txt`?
* Are there any `last_exception.txt` or `last_exception*.txt` files in `The Sims 4`?


* When installed properly this is not necessary at all.
For manual installations check these things and make sure each question can be answered with 'yes'.
* Does 'The Sims 4' (localized to Die Sims 4, Les Sims 4, Los Sims 4, The Sims 4, ...) exist?
  * Does `The Sims 4` contain the folder `Mods`?
    * Does `Mods` contain the folder `_o19_`? 
      * Does `_19_` contain `ts4lib.ts4script` and `ts4lib.package` files?
      * Does `_19_` contain `{mod_name}.ts4script` and/or `{mod_name}.package` files?
  * Does `The Sims 4` contain the folder `mod_data`?
    * Does `mod_data` contain the folder `{mod_name}`?
      * Does `{mod_name}` contain files or folders?
  * Does `The Sims 4` contain the `mod_logs` ?
    * Does `mod_logs` contain the file `Sims4CommunityLib_*_Messages.txt`?
    * Does `mod_logs` contain the file `TS4-Library_*_Messages.txt`?
      * Is this the most recent version or can it be updated?
    * Does `mod_logs` contain the file `{mod_name}_*_Messages.txt`?
      * Is this the most recent version or can it be updated?
  * Doesn't `The Sims 4` contain the file(s) `last_exception.txt`  and/or `last_exception*.txt` ?
* Share the `The Sims 4/mod_logs/Sims4CommunityLib_*_Messages.txt` and `The Sims 4/mod_logs/{mod_name}_*_Messages.txt`  file.

If issues persist, share:
`mod_logs/Sims4CommunityLib_*_Messages.txt`
`mod_logs/{mod_name}_*_Messages.txt`
