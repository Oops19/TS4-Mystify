# Mystify for TS4

Mystify is a small mod which allows adding temporary transparency to sims and objects. The modifications are not persisted in a save game.

* Everything between 30 and 100 % is quite safe to apply.
* With 0 to 20 % opacity sims and objects are hard to see for the player and one can't click on them.
* Sims will still interact with invisible sims and objects.

The normal menu allows to set the opacity to 40, 60, 80 and 100 % (Show).
The 'more' menu adds 30, 50, 70 and 70 %.
The 'risky' menu supports (Hide) 0, 10 and 20 %.
The 'reset' menu allows to reset all sims and/or objects.
To reset the currently played sim select a random sim or object and select Mystify > Reset > Self.

### Future

A 'TheVoid/Nothingness' class is planned. It should be triggered by transparent objects and make one object after the other within the zone invisible.

* Locate the localized `The Sims 4` folder which contains the `Mods` folder.
* Extract the ZIP file into this `The Sims 4` folder.
* It will create the directories/files `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.ts4script`, `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.package`, `mod_data/$mod_name/*` and/or `mod_documentation/$mod_name/*`
* `mod_logs/$mod_name.txt` will be created as soon as data is logged.

### Manual Installation
If you don't want to extract the ZIP file into `The Sims 4` folder you might want to read this. 
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_data` are usually required and should be extracted to `The Sims 4/mod_data`.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_documentation` are for you to read it. They are not needed to use this mod.
* The `Mods/_o19_/*.ts4script` files can be stored in a random folder within `Mods` or directly in `Mods`. I highly recommend to store it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.
